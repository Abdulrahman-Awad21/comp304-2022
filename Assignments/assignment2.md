# Assignment 2

### 2/28/2022

1. Read Sections 3.3.3, 3.3.4, 3.3.5, 3.4, 3.6

2. **(Paper)** Write a FA to describe a valid C++ identifier -- sequence of characters, digits and underscores but does not start with a digit, does not have two consecutive underscores, and obviously not a keyword.  **The FA should reject any invalid identifier and should accept any valid identifier**.

3. **(Paper)** Write a regular expression for a valid C++ identifier (similar to the above question).

4. **(Lab)** Write a C++ program that reads a file that has only a C++ for loop sentence and generates the corresponding stream of tokens written in a file. The implementation should be "simple" and hard-coded as explained in the lecture
