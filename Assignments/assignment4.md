# Assignment 4

### 3/14/2022
1. Read sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4.1, 4.4.2

2. Write a grammar for expressions that can include binary operators (`+` and `x`), unary minus (`-`), autoincrement (`++`), and autodecrement (`--`) with their customary precedence. Assume that repeated unary minuses are not allowed, but that repeated autoincrement and autodecrement operators are allowed. _You can use ANTLR to validate your grammar ðŸ˜‰._
    - Modify the grammar to remove any direct left recursion (if it has).
    - BONUS: Try your best to write a parser (we have not discussed this in the lecture yet).
